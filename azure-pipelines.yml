# This is the complex Azure configuration, which is intended for use
# on open source libraries which need compatibility across multiple GHC
# versions, must work with cabal-install, and should be
# cross-platform. For more information and other options, see:

# https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/azure_ci/
#
# For better organization, you split various jobs into seprate parts
# and each of them are controlled via individual file.
